# Legion Surveillance API docs
Yes, we have an API that people can use.

## Our API
Out API is currently **unfinished** we do not recommend using the API in prodduction as of yet. Even so, we are providing some documentation to get started.

## Warning
These docs are incomplete and also a skeleton. Some things laid out in the documentation may or may not exist as these are based off planned features and parameters not finised and published ones.

## The Future
This repo will be updated with the planned API Endpoints and how to use them.
